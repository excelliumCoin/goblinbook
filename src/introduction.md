# Introduction

This book is intended for tech-savy readers, interested in learning extremely advanced blockchain and interoperability concepts. Although it explains some of the most complex topics in blockchain, we do try to start at the basics.

Various chapters are accompanied by coding projects. The complete version of each project is checked in our book [repository](https://github.com/unionlabs/goblinbook/tree/main/projects).
